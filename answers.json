Many other organisms, such as spiders, beetles, caterpillars, and fleas, also produce silk. Additionally, wild silk from caterpillars has been used in regions like China, Europe, and South Asia for centuries, indicating that silk production is not exclusive to Bombyx mori. A monopoly would imply exclusive supply, which is not the case here."
